These Problem Solving Help Videos provide step-by-step solutions to typical problem solved in an undergraduate course on Vibrations and Waves. Along with each video, Professor Busza has included two sample problems for you to solve. Answers and hints are provided, but not full solutions.

_NOTE: These videos were originally produced as part of a physics course that is no longer available on OCW._
